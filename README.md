# node-systeminformation
System Information Library for Node.JS implemented using C++ addon with Node-API.

Compared with [systeminformation](https://github.com/sebhildebrandt/systeminformation) library, this library is more implemented in C++, generally it will be faster than [systeminformation](https://github.com/sebhildebrandt/systeminformation) library, and this library avoids the requirement of command line permissions on Windows, which makes it more applicable good.

But this library is in the process of being conceived, it can't cover all the information in [systeminformation](https://github.com/sebhildebrandt/systeminformation) library, and the structure and naming are not standardized enough, looking forward to your joining to make it better.
